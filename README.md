# Galleryzer
Chrome image gallery extension. Creates an image gallery out of all the images on page that are above the size specified in extension settings (to avoid showing header and banner images etc).

* Lightweight - doesn't use any additional Javascript libraries.
* Responsive - scales between 2-4 columns based on browser window size.
* No duplicate images. Checks image sources for duplicate images so for example on forums where the same image might be quoted multiple times, the gallery only shows one instance of it.
* Support for showing forum navigation and automatically opening Galleryzer on the next loaded page.
* Light and dark theme option.
* Lightbox for showing image in full size. Also handles links leading to a larger version of the image.
* Open from toolbar button, close by using Esc key, clicking toolbar button or clicking outside the frame of the gallery.
